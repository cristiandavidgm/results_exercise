# Results
Results is a purely academic exercise develop as a technical test. 
It is quite simple, takes a list of results from a CSV file, parses it and exposes a REST endpoint that allows getting division-seasons pairs and the results for every given division-season.

The main idea was to keep it simple to allow an easy review of the code, it is not production ready, it laking code instrumentation and more sophisticated orchestration.
